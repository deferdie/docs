## What is Docs?

[Codecademy Docs](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs) is a free, easily accessible reference for coding terms and concepts, available to developers all over the world. If you forget what JavaScript hoisting is, we want you to be able to look up "JS hoisting" on any search engine, click a Codecademy Doc entry, and have an answer in seconds.

## What stage of development are we in right now?

Docs is live with over 1000 high-quality entries. Now that the MVP is out, our goal is to transition some ownership of Docs content to the Codecademy community, since maintaining a resource of this type at-scale is only possible if it's open-contribution. That means we need your help, whether it's contributing, reviewing, or evangelizing!
